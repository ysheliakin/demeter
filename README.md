# Development

- Install Go: https://go.dev/doc/install 

- (optional) Install [air](https://github.com/cosmtrek/air?tab=readme-ov-file#installation) to track code changes on the fly. Might need to add $GOPATH/bin in your PATH somewhat like [so](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70098792/go-install-do-i-need-to-manually-update-my-path) or [so](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/18583).

- If using Air, run in the project directory:

```bash
air
```

- Or just run (need to restart the server any time you make code changes):

```
go run *.go
```

- Enjoy the website at localhost:42069.
